    <h1>Josia Paska Darmawan</h1>
    <p>A multi-hyphenate researcher, consultant, strategist, and responsible innovation advocate. My work spans multiple disciplines and sectors, but at the heart of it all is one vision: to build a more just and inclusive world.</p>

    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I grew up in a small town in Indonesia, raised by a lineman and a homemaker. My parents had done all kinds of work, from being a domestic worker to selling miscellaneous things on foot just to keep life going. I am a first-generation college graduate. A queer, soft-mannered kid who was often bullied, often excluded, and constantly searching for safety and self-understanding.</p>

    <p>With limited resources and little access to affirming spaces, I found refuge in books, learning, and later, the internet. It was online that I began to explore questions around gender and identity. Those digital spaces gave me language, clarity, and most importantly, community. That’s where I found myself.</p>
    
    <p>This personal journey is the root of my professional work. I am not loud and bold enough to be at the frontline of activism. I prefer working behind the scenes—quietly but persistently advocating for equity and inclusion. Over time, though, I’ve learned that even soft voices deserve to be heard. So I started writing. Then speaking. Then showing up.</p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>My work spans the fields of digital justice, responsible innovation, technology ethics, and systems change. I collaborate with ecosystem builders, think tanks, government agencies, and grassroots communities to generate knowledge, design ethical systems, and advocate for impactful programs. I'm especially passionate about equity and justice for the most vulnerable—LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and under-served communities in the Global South.</p>
    <p>I bring not only professional rigor, but also deep cultural sensitivity and empathy rooted in my own lived experience. Whether I’m reviewing a publication, designing a policy framework, or facilitating a conversation between technologists and human rights advocates, I aim to center the most marginalized and challenge the systems that exclude them.</p>

    <h2>My Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: I strive to ensure no one is left behind. I believe in intentionally uplifting those at the margins and enabling their meaningful participation.</li>
      <li><strong>Humanity</strong>: I prioritize our shared humanity over constructed divisions. Our empathy should be the foundation of every design, system, and policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Diversity</strong>: I see diversity not as an afterthought, but as the engine of innovation. A future designed by many, for many, is one that holds the greatest promise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vision & Dreams</h2>
    <p>I dream of a world that celebrates differences; where technologies are created with compassion and where marginalized voices are not only included, but centered. I want to help build systems that uplift people, not exploit them.</p>
    <p>I see myself as a bridge between technologists and humanists, between policymakers and grassroots communities, and between the Global North and the Global South. Through my works, I want to infuse innovation with empathy and to remind the world that progress must never come at the expense of the most vulnerable.</p>

    <h2>This Space</h2>
    <p>This website is not just a portfolio. It’s a sanctuary. A quiet room on the internet where people of all identities—especially the minoritized and misunderstood—can feel seen, affirmed, and safe. Thank you for being here. I hope you find warmth and solidarity in these pages.</p>
