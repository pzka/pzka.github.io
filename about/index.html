    <h1>Hi, I'm Josia Paska.</h1>
    <p>A multi-hyphenate researcher, strategist, and responsible innovation advocate based in the Global South.</p>

    <h2>Welcome to My Space</h2>
    <p>I wear many hats: researcher, consultant, facilitator, social data analyst, editor, and beyond. My work spans multiple disciplines and sectors, but at the heart of it all is one vision: to build a more just and inclusive world. I'm currently based in Jakarta, Indonesia, but my work and values are deeply rooted in global solidarity. This website is not just a portfolio—it's a sanctuary. A place where every visitor, especially those from minoritized and marginalized communities, is welcomed and affirmed.</p>

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p>My core work lies at the intersection of research, strategy, and social impact. I collaborate with organizations, think tanks, and grassroots communities to generate knowledge, design ethical systems, and advocate for meaningful change. I'm especially passionate about equity and justice for the most vulnerable—LGBTQIA+ individuals, people with disabilities, and under-served communities in the Global South.</p>
    <p>Beyond consulting and research, I bring value as an editor and cultural reviewer, thanks to my lived experiences and nuanced understanding of diverse social contexts. My work becomes truly meaningful when I see it spark systemic shifts, inspire others, or help unheard voices rise into clarity.</p>

    <h2>My Values</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Inclusivity</strong>: I strive to ensure no one is left behind. I believe in intentionally uplifting those at the margins and enabling their meaningful participation.</li>
      <li><strong>Humanity</strong>: I prioritize our shared humanity over constructed divisions. Our empathy should be the foundation of every design, system, and policy.</li>
      <li><strong>Diversity</strong>: I see diversity not as an afterthought, but as the engine of innovation. A future designed by many, for many, is one that holds the greatest promise.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Vision & Dreams</h2>
    <p>I dream of a world that celebrates difference; where technologies are created with compassion, and where marginalized voices are not only included, but centered. I want to help build systems that uplift people, not exploit them. I see myself as a bridge: between technologists and humanists, between policymakers and grassroots communities, between the Global North and the Global South.</p>
    <p>I want to put heart into technology, to infuse innovation with empathy, and to remind the world that progress must never come at the expense of the most vulnerable.</p>
